-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=hooded-figure--commission-by-katagro-on-deviantart>Hooded Figure / Commission By Katagro On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hooded-figure--commission-by-katagro-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://img08.deviantart.net/2576/i/2015/202/2/a/hooded_figure___commission_by_katagro-d8y340h.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.dQpMXH2F8sTIK6TgCYV0iAHaJ4&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Hooded Figure / Commission by katagro on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: katagro.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>How to Choose the Right Wallpaper for Your Home: Factors to Consider
